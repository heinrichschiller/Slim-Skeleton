# Slim-Skeleton

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/heinrichschiller/Slim-Skeleton.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/github/heinrichschiller/Slim-Skeleton)

My own (non official) simple slim skeleton app, for websites, apis and webapps. It is not better than the official Slim-Skeleton, it is more a composer package and has my own configuration for my work with Slim. If you don't know what to take, take the original :)
